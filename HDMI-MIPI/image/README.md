You can have a gain of 3dB, 6dB, 9dB, 12dB or 15dB.

- 15dB if a 100K resistor is connected between GAIN and GND
- 12dB if GAIN is connected directly to GND
- 9dB if GAIN is not connected to anything
- 6dB if GAIN is conneted directly to Vin
- 3dB if a 100K resistor is connected between GAIN and Vin
